<p> I currently work as an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. </p>
    
<p>  My research focuses mainly on macroeconomics and political economy. Most of my work can be traced back to two main research projects. The first is concerned with the interaction between politics and markets. The second explores the macroeconomic effects of aggregate demand dynamics, with special emphasis on medium- and long-run effects.
Underlying these two projects are two ‘intellectual bets’. The first is that political partisanship matters for markets, and something relevant about contemporary economies and societies can be learned from this interaction. The second is that, contrary to the current mainstream consensus in macroeconomics, aggregate demand dynamics can have tangible long-run implications for macroeconomic aggregates. </p>
