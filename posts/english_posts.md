<em>In May 2018, Italy experienced a serious institutional crisis. On May 27th its President Mattarella, in a unprecedented move, vetoed the formation of a Government which would have been backed by an absolute majority in Parliament. I thought the crisis had a deep meaning and was revealing about the interactions between democracy, financial markets and private wealth, that most observers (including on the Left) were missing. I therefore wrote down some reflections on it, and uploaded them here. </em>
