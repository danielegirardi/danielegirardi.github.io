A new study casts some doubts on a popular hypothesis</a></strong></span> (Spanish version publised on Feb 1, 2024 in Nada es Gratis)<br>
<em>English version of a blog post published in Spanish by <a href="https://nadaesgratis.es/admin/estudiar-economia-te-hace-egoista-y-conservador" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nada es Gratis</a>. I summarize my research (coauthored with Sai Madhurika Mamunuru, Simon Halliday and Sam Bowles) on the effect of studying economics on students' preferences and political opinions. </em>

That’s not unusual.</a></strong></span> (Published on <b>The Washington Post</b> on Jan 24, 2022)<br>
<em>Financial markets did not offer a warm welcome to Gabriel Boric, Chile’s newly elected leftist president. This conforms to a systematic pattern of adverse market reactions to left and center-left electoral victories. I discuss why this happens, what it means, and what are the implications for democratic politics, based on my research on the politics of financial markets. </em>

<em>In May 2018, Italy experienced a serious institutional crisis. On May 27th its President Mattarella, in a unprecedented move, vetoed the formation of a Government which would have been backed by an absolute majority in Parliament. I thought the crisis had a deep meaning and was revealing about the interactions between democracy, financial markets and private wealth, that most observers (including on the Left) were missing. I therefore wrote down some reflections on it, and uploaded them here. </em>

With Walter Paternesi Meloni and Antonella Stirati)<br>
<em>Contrary to the neoclassical model’s assumptions, shifts in aggregate demand have persistent effects on GDP. This post - published on the Institute for New Economic Thinking Blog - summarizes some of our research on the topic.</em>
