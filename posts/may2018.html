<p>(May 29, 2018)</p>
<p>Italy is experiencing a serious institutional crisis. On May 27<sup>th</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>Italy&rsquo;s President Mattarella, in an historically unprecedented move, vetoed the formation of a &lsquo;populist&rsquo; government which had the support of an absolute parliamentary majority, composed of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the right-wing Lega. The veto concerned, specifically, the coalition&rsquo;s choice for Finance Minister, 81-years old Paolo Savona, an economist and experienced public official.</p>
<p>Those on the (Italian and international) Left who are either applauding the blocking of what would arguably have been a reactionary Government or engaging in endless discussions on whether Mattarella abused his powers or just enforced Italy&rsquo;s glorious Constitution, are mistaken and fail to appreciate the deep meaning of the Italian institutional crisis. Unfortunately, this includes Pietro Grasso, the leader of the only Left-wing party represented in the Italian Parliament (&lsquo;Free and Equals&rsquo;, LeU), who expressed his support for Mattarella&rsquo;s move.<a href="http://www.reconomics.it/italys-institutional-crisis-the-euro-and-the-left/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Italy&rsquo;s institutional crisis</strong></p>
<p>President Mattarella&rsquo;s veto is motivated by the suspicion that Paolo Savona, if appointed Finance Minister, may have attempted to bring the country out of the Eurozone. The suspicion is based on a reading of some of Savona&rsquo;s recent writings. Savona has denied this intention.</p>
